So what (one sentence)
Stochastic population models show that frequent hurricanes drive long-term decline of Acropora palmata, and that recovery depends disproportionately on the survival and growth of large colonies.

Study context
Species: Acropora palmata
Region: Northern Florida Keys, USA
Disturbance regime: Hurricanes (notably 2005), bleaching, predation
Management context: ESA recovery planning

Methods (inference-relevant only)
- Annual demographic surveys across 15 permanent plots (2004–2010)
- Size-based matrix population models with disturbance
- Elasticity analysis to identify key life stages
- Simulated outplanting and hurricane-return scenarios

Key results (numbers first)
- Percent cover, colony abundance, and large-colony dominance declined over time
- Hurricane return times ≤20 years predicted continued population depletion
- Largest size class contributed most to population growth (highest elasticity)
- Outplanting larger colonies improved short-term population trajectories

Mechanisms / drivers
- Disturbance alters transition probabilities (growth, shrinkage, fragmentation)
- Fragmentation increases ramet numbers but reduces resilience
- Background growth-to-shrinkage ratios insufficient for recovery

Restoration-relevant takeaways
- Size matters more than colony number for recovery
- Restoration should prioritize growing colonies to large size before outplanting
- Storm regimes must be explicitly incorporated into restoration planning

Limitations / external validity
- Focused on moderate-density stands in the Florida Keys
- Does not separate genets and ramets

Anchor numbers & quotable facts
- Most populations at 2–20% of 1970s baselines
- Large colonies dominate elasticity of λ
