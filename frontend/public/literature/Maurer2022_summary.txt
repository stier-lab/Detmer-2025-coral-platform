ABSTRACT:
Acroporid corals are one of the most important corals in the Caribbean because of their role in building coral reefs. Unfortunately, Acropora corals have suffered a severe decline in the last 50 years thus prompting the development of many restoration practices, such as coral nurseries, to increase the abundance of these species. However, many coral nursery designs require constant visits and maintenance limiting restoration to more convenient sites. Additionally, most studies lack the details required for practitioners to make informed decisions about replicating nursery designs. Two line nurseries were monitored for three years in The Bahamas to assess the survival of corals, Acropora cervicornis and Acropora palmata, as well as evaluate the durability and cost effectiveness of the nursery design. Survivorship ranged from 70 to 97% with one location experiencing significantly higher survivorship. The initial year build-out cost was high for a nursery, $22.97 per coral, but each nursery was comprised of specific materials that could withstand high storm conditions. Some unique aspects of the design included the use of longline clips and large-diameter monofilament lines which allowed for easier adjustments and more vigorous cleaning. The design proved to be very durable with materials showing a life expectancy of five years or more. Additionally, the design was able to withstand multiple hurricanes and winter storm conditions with little to no damage. Only two maintenance visits a year were required reducing costs after construction. After three years, this nursery design showed promising durability of materials and survivorship of both Acropora cervicornis and Acropora palmata despite being serviced just twice a year.

KEY FINDINGS FOR ACROPORA PULCHRA RESTORATION:

1. LOW-MAINTENANCE NURSERY DESIGN VIABLE: Only 2 maintenance visits/year required, with 10 labor hours per visit for 128 corals (4.7 min/coral). Design withstood Hurricanes Dorian, Irma, Maria and multiple winter storms. For A. pulchra restoration in remote or storm-prone areas, this demonstrates feasibility of infrequent-visit nursery operations.

2. HIGH SURVIVAL ACROSS 3 YEARS: Both A. cervicornis (70-94%) and A. palmata (75-97%) survived on the same nursery system, with site-specific variation. Glassbottom nursery achieved 96% overall survival vs. 74% at Castaway, likely due to light/water quality differences. Site selection remains critical.

3. GENOTYPE AFFECTS SURVIVAL: Among 4 A. palmata genotypes, significant survival differences emerged (Rocky2 lowest, Rocky/Gorda highest). For A. pulchra restoration, genetic diversity should be maintained but genotype performance should be tracked—some lineages may be systematically less fit.

4. COST-EFFECTIVE LONG-TERM: Initial cost $22.97/coral is high, but materials lasted 5+ years without replacement. Horizontal lines need replacement at ~5 years; vertical lines and buoys still functional at 7 years. Total lifecycle cost competitive with more frequent-maintenance designs.

5. ENVIRONMENTAL PARAMETERS DRIVE SITE DIFFERENCES: 0.1°C temperature difference and significant light differences (higher turbidity at lower-survival site) between nurseries only 1 km apart. For A. pulchra, even nearby sites may perform very differently—microhabitat selection within a reef system matters for nursery placement.
