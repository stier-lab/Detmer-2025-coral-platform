ABSTRACT
Fragmentation and local dispersion of hurricane-generated fragments have been considered an important feature in the life history, population dynamics and genetic structure of the elkhorn coral Acropora palmata. The significance of fragmentation as a strategy of this species to maintain local populations in the time of their recent decline was assessed by studying the dynamics and size structure of Hurricane Georges (1998) generated fragments in three reefs (Media Luna Reef, Laurel Reef and San Cristóbal Reef) within La Parguera coral reef system on the southwestern coast of Puerto Rico. Two belt transects (30 m long and 2 m wide) were established across the largest patch of living A. palmata in each reef. All fragments with living tissue were counted, labeled and measured. No significant difference in mean fragment densities was observed among reefs (p> 0.05; Tukey-Kramer). Fragment abundance after a year was 369 (1.02 ± 0.35 fragments/m²). No significant relationships were observed between fragment density and coral cover or with the types of reef substrates observed in each transect. However, there was a significant difference (p< 0.05, Tukey-Kramer) in mean fragment size (length, width and surface area) among reefs. The mean overall mortality within the first year was 28.24 ± 3.68% (n= 151 fragments from San Cristóbal Reef only), after 3 years was 47.96 ± 17.71% (n= 254 fragments from all reefs). Fragment mortality at San Cristóbal Reef was significantly lower (22.92 ± 10.42%) than at Media Luna and Laurel Reefs (60.54 ± 6.13%, 60.43 ± 8.43%, respectively; p< 0.025, ANOVA). Mean percentage of colonies with partial tissue mortality in the first year was significantly higher (85.92 ± 4.94%) compared to 3 years (50.81 ± 12.53%; p< 0.05, t-test). After three years, loose fragments were significantly more abundant than cemented fragments, and the major mode of cementation was by means of coralline algae calcification (average= 29.92%, n= 254 fragments). No significant differences were found in mean fragment survivorships across different conditions (loose, slight stable or cemented fragments). Substrates had a moderate effect on the survival rate within the first year, but after three years, significantly lower survivorship was observed in those fragments that landed over sand compared to those on hard substrates and standing live colonies. A positive and significant relationship (Regression, p< 0.01; R²= 0.63-0.77) was observed between fragment size (length and surface area) and mortality with a possible threshold size (20-25 cm length) above which fragments are less likely to die in the first year. The predicted decline of populations by the fragment size-based models suggests a complex response of populations to recent environmental change and may be related to the recent demise of this species in the wider Caribbean.

KEY FINDINGS FOR ACROPORA PULCHRA RESTORATION CONTEXT

1. SIZE-DEPENDENT SURVIVAL WITH THRESHOLD: Significant positive relationship between fragment size and survival (R²= 0.63-0.77). Critical threshold of 20-25 cm length above which fragments are substantially more likely to survive the first year. After 7 years of simulation, survival predictions: 10% for 10 cm² fragments vs. 67% for 1000 cm² fragments. For A. pulchra restoration, targeting fragments >25 cm length would dramatically improve outcomes.

2. HIGH PARTIAL MORTALITY DRIVES POPULATION DECLINE: 85.9% of fragments showed partial tissue mortality in year 1, losing mean 61.7% of tissue. This tissue loss (shrinkage) pushes fragments into smaller size classes with higher mortality—a feedback loop driving population extinction in models within 8-12 years. This mechanism of decline through size-class transitions is critical for restoration demographic modeling.

3. FIRST-YEAR MORTALITY IS ELEVATED: Mean mortality 28.2% in year 1 vs. declining rates thereafter. Models show λ (population growth rate) of 0.53-0.68 depending on starting size and time since disturbance—all indicating population decline. Early post-transplant monitoring and intervention may be critical for A. pulchra restoration success.

4. SUBSTRATE AFFECTS LONG-TERM BUT NOT SHORT-TERM SURVIVAL: No substrate effect in year 1, but by year 3, fragments on sand had significantly lower survival than hard substrate or living colonies. Only 48% of fragments were cemented after 3 years; coralline algae encrustation (29.9%) was the primary attachment mechanism, not coral self-attachment (6.3%). Substrate selection and facilitated attachment may improve A. pulchra restoration outcomes.

5. SITE-SPECIFIC VARIATION IS SUBSTANTIAL: San Cristóbal Reef showed 22.9% mortality vs. 60% at Media Luna and Laurel Reefs over 3 years. Water quality differences (nitrogen levels) may explain this—restoration site selection and local environmental conditions strongly influence fragment fate. This supports need for site-specific parameter estimation in restoration planning.
