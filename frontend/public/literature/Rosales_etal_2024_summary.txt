So what (one sentence)
Survivorship of outplanted Acropora palmata is driven more by reef-scale habitat conditions and associated microbiomes than by coral genotype, highlighting current velocity, depth, and nutrient regime as key levers for restoration success.

Study context
Species: Acropora palmata
Region: Upper Florida Keys, USA
Restoration context: Nursery-grown fragments outplanted by Coral Restoration Foundation
Genets: CN2, CN4, ML2, HS1
Habitats/Reefs: Carysfort Reef, North Dry Rocks, Pickles Reef
Study duration: 2018–2019

Methods (inference-relevant only)
- Longitudinal survivorship tracking of outplanted fragments (~532 days)
- Environmental monitoring: SST, chlorophyll-a, nutrients (NO3-, NO2-, PO4^3-, Si), current velocity
- Microbiome characterization via 16S rRNA sequencing
- Cox proportional hazards models and correlations between microbiome composition and survivorship

Key results (numbers first)
- Survivorship varied strongly among reefs; Carysfort Reef had the lowest survivorship
- Higher survivorship correlated with:
  - Higher current velocity
  - Shallower outplant depth
- Relative abundance of Rhodobacterales was negatively correlated with survivorship
- Higher nutrients and temperature were associated with increased Alteromonadales (putative pathogens)
- Genotype effects were weak compared to habitat effects

Mechanisms / drivers
- Physical flushing (currents) likely reduces pathogen buildup and thermal stress
- Microbiome shifts reflect environmental filtering rather than host genet identity
- Nutrient enrichment promotes microbial taxa associated with stress or disease

Restoration-relevant takeaways
- Prioritize sites with high current velocity and shallow depth
- Avoid sites with elevated nitrate/nitrite concentrations
- Microbiome composition can serve as an early-warning indicator of site suitability
- Genotype choice alone is insufficient to ensure restoration success

Limitations / external validity
- Observational correlations limit causal inference
- Restricted to Florida Keys reef settings and four genets

Anchor numbers & quotable facts
- Habitat explained more survivorship variation than genotype
- Rhodobacterales abundance inversely related to survivorship
