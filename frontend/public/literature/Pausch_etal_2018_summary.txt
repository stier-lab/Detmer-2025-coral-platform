So what (one sentence)
Under repeated thermal stress, Acropora palmata outplant success is driven far more by genotype and site than fragment size, with some genotypes acting as high-performing generalists across habitats and others failing catastrophically, challenging assumptions about local adaptation in restoration.

Study context
Species: Acropora palmata (elkhorn coral)
Region: Upper Florida Keys, USA
Restoration context: Nursery-grown outplants used for population enhancement under ESA recovery planning
Environmental backdrop: Severe thermal stress events in summers 2014 and 2015, coincident with experiments
Habitats compared: Fore reef vs mid-channel patch reef
Key stressors: Thermal bleaching, disease, corallivorous snails (Coralliophila abbreviata), site-specific effects

Methods (inference-relevant only)
Two field experiments:
1) Size experiment (2014–2016)
- Two fragment size classes (small vs large) from a single genotype (SLg)
- n = 126 paired outplants across 3 fore reef sites
- Size quantified using live area index (LAI)
- Response variables: survivorship, bleaching severity, net change in LAI, snail presence

2) Genotype × habitat experiment (2015–2016)
- Four genotypes (CN1g, CN2g, HSg, SLg)
- Two habitat types (fore reef, patch reef), 3 sites each
- n = 720 total outplants (~40 cm² LAI each)
- Same response variables as above

Key results (numbers first)
Fragment size effects:
- Survivorship did not differ between size classes (~25–26% across sites after ~2.5 years)
- Small fragments bleached significantly less than large fragments during peak 2014 bleaching
- Small fragments showed greater net growth (+214 ± 34 cm² LAI) than large fragments (+103 ± 37 cm² LAI)

Genotype effects:
- CN2g showed highest survivorship (64–86%), lowest bleaching, and highest growth
- SLg showed poorest performance (48% survivorship fore reef; 6% patch reef)

Habitat and site effects:
- Patch reefs experienced higher thermal stress (up to 22 days >31.2°C)
- Bleaching severity and genotype differences were amplified in patch reefs

Mechanisms / drivers
Thermal stress exposure, genotype-specific tolerance, site-specific disease and predation, and depth-related buffering effects.

Restoration-relevant takeaways
- Fragment size within tested range is not a primary driver of survivorship
- Smaller fragments can improve nursery efficiency without sacrificing survival
- Genotype selection is critical; generalist genotypes may outperform local sources under climate change
- Fine-scale site selection is essential

Limitations / external validity
Limited genotype pool; results reflect performance under severe thermal stress conditions.

Anchor numbers
- Survivorship small vs large: ~25–26%
- CN2g survivorship up to 86%
- SLg mortality at patch reefs: ~94%
