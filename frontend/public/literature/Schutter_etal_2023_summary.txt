So what (one sentence)
Feeding during ex-situ culture strongly enhances growth and post-outplant survival of sexually produced Acropora palmata recruits, whereas elevated alkalinity alone does not.

Study context
Species: Acropora palmata
Region: Bahamas
Restoration context: Sexual propagation and reef rehabilitation
Life stage: Larvae to juvenile recruits

Methods (inference-relevant only)
- Ex-situ fertilization, larval rearing, and settlement on aragonite plugs
- Four aquaculture treatments: ambient vs high alkalinity, with vs without feeding
- Three culture durations: 4, 9, 14 weeks
- Survival tracked during aquaculture and up to 44 weeks post-settlement

Key results (numbers first)
- Feeding significantly increased polyp number and tissue area
- High alkalinity alone reduced survival during aquaculture
- Best performance: high alkalinity + feeding for 9 weeks
  - ~2× higher survival and recruit size at 10 months vs ambient
- No natural recruitment observed at field sites

Mechanisms / drivers
- Heterotrophic feeding accelerates early growth and size refuge
- Larger size at outplanting reduces early post-settlement mortality
- Elevated alkalinity without sufficient energy supply is detrimental

Restoration-relevant takeaways
- Feeding is a critical lever for sexual coral propagation
- Optimal ex-situ culture duration balances cost and size benefits
- Sexual restoration can outperform natural recruitment under degraded conditions

Limitations / external validity
- Single species and region
- Costs of feeding and infrastructure not fully quantified

Anchor numbers & quotable facts
- Feeding doubled survival and size at 10 months
- Ambient conditions outperformed natural recruitment (zero recruits)
