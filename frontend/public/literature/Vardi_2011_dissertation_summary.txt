So what (one sentence)
Size-structured population models show that Acropora palmata populations in most of the Caribbean are on trajectories of long-term stagnation or decline, with recovery hinging on the persistence of large colonies, disturbance regimes, and herbivory.

Study context
Species: Acropora palmata
Region: Florida Keys, Curaçao, Jamaica (with supplementary Caribbean sites)
Conservation context: ESA-listed threatened species; recovery planning and policy
Temporal scale: Annual demographic surveys (2004–2010 Florida; ≥4 years elsewhere)

Methods (inference-relevant only)
- Size-based, stochastic matrix population models incorporating disturbance (hurricanes)
- Colonies classified into four size classes using planar projected live surface area
- Elasticity and projection analyses to 2030 and 2100
- Empirical calibration during both hurricane and non-hurricane years
- Comparative regional demographic analyses

Key results (numbers first)
- Florida Keys projected to remain at ~4% benthic cover through 2030 and 2100
- Large colonies (size class >4000 cm²) had the highest elasticity for population growth
- Severe hurricanes with return times ≤20 years led to continued population decline
- Jamaica populations projected to increase, unlike Florida and Curaçao

Mechanisms / drivers
- Disproportionate contribution of large colonies to both sexual and asexual reproduction
- Storm-driven fragmentation increases colony counts but erodes size structure
- High Diadema antillarum densities in Jamaica linked to positive population trajectories

Restoration-relevant takeaways
- Protecting and rebuilding large colonies is critical
- Outplanting larger fragments improves short-term population growth
- Herbivore recovery (urchins) can facilitate coral population recovery
- Demographic models provide explicit targets for restoration scale and density

Limitations / external validity
- Genet vs ramet distinction not possible in field surveys
- Projections assume stationary life-history parameters

Anchor numbers & quotable facts
- Florida A. palmata projected near functional extinction without intervention
- Jamaica shows recovery ~30 years after urchin die-off
