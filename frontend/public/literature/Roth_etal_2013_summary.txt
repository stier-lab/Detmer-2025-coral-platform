So what (one sentence)
Thermal stress increases fragmentation in Acropora palmata, inflating colony counts while eroding size structure and masking true population vulnerability.

Study context
Species: Acropora palmata (Caribbean), corymbose Acropora spp. (Japan)
Regions: US Virgin Islands; Aka Jima, Japan
Disturbances: Thermal anomalies (1998 Japan; 2005 Caribbean)

Methods (inference-relevant only)
- Long-term field tracking of colony size, fragmentation, and mortality
- Bayesian discrete-time model distinguishing genets from ramets
- Size-frequency distributions analyzed pre-, during-, and post-thermal stress

Key results (numbers first)
- Fragmentation rates increased sharply during thermal stress for A. palmata
- Caribbean A. palmata fragmented more frequently than Pacific corymbose Acropora
- Thermal stress shifted size-frequency distributions toward small colonies
- Fragmentation increased ramet density but not genet diversity

Mechanisms / drivers
- Partial mortality during bleaching weakens skeletons, increasing breakage
- Small fragments suffer higher mortality, reducing long-term resilience
- Apparent population growth can reflect cloning, not recovery

Restoration-relevant takeaways
- Fragment abundance is a misleading metric of recovery
- Restoration monitoring must distinguish genets vs ramets
- High fragmentation may signal stress rather than resilience
- Protecting large colonies is critical for maintaining population structure

Limitations / external validity
- Model assumes initial genets are distinct
- Limited species representation outside Acropora

Anchor numbers & quotable facts
- Peak fragmentation coincided with thermal anomaly years
- Size distributions narrowed or shifted toward small colonies after stress
