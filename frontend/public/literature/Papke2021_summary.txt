ABSTRACT
Global decline of coral reefs has led to a widespread adoption of asexual propagation techniques for coral restoration, whereby coral colonies are fragmented and allowed to re-grow before being returned to the reef. While this approach has become increasingly popular and successful, many questions remain regarding best practices to maximize restoration speed, efficiency, and survival. Two variables that may influence growth and survival of asexually fragmented colonies include coral genet and growth substrate. Here, we evaluate the effects of genet and substrate (commercially available ceramic vs. in-house made cement) on the survival and growth of 221 microfragments of elkhorn coral Acropora palmata over 193 days. All corals survived the experimental period, and doubled their initial size in 45 days, with an average growth of 545% over the study duration. Growth was generally linear, though the growth of some corals more closely matched logistic, logarithmic, or exponential curves. Both genet and substrate had significant effects on coral growth, though the two factors did not interact. Genet had a stronger influence on coral growth than substrate, with the fastest genet growing at 216% the rate of the slowest genet. Corals on cement substrate grew at 111.9% the rate of those grown on ceramic. This represents both a significant cost savings and elimination of logistical challenges to restoration practitioners, as the cement substrate ingredients are cheap and globally available. Our work shows that both genet and substrate should be considered when undertaking asexual restoration of Acropora palmata to maximize restoration speed and efficiency.

KEY FINDINGS FOR ACROPORA PULCHRA RESTORATION CONTEXT

1. 100% SURVIVAL AND RAPID GROWTH OF MICROFRAGMENTS: All 221 microfragments (starting size ~0.57 cm²) survived 193 days in ex situ culture, doubling initial size in just 45 days and achieving 545% mean growth (final size 3.08 cm²). Mean growth rate 0.0125 cm²/day. For A. pulchra restoration, microfragmentation offers very high survival in controlled nursery conditions with predictable, rapid growth.

2. GENET EFFECTS DOMINATE OVER SUBSTRATE: Fastest genet grew at 216% the rate of slowest genet (0.0166 vs 0.0077 cm²/day). Genet explained more variance than substrate in multi-model averaging (96.6% of model weights included genet vs 91.2% for substrate). Genet × substrate interaction was weak (only 14.4% of model weights). For A. pulchra, genotype selection may be the most important controllable factor for maximizing nursery production.

3. CEMENT OUTPERFORMS CERAMIC SUBSTRATE: Corals on in-house cement plugs grew 111.9% the rate of commercial ceramic plugs (0.0132 vs 0.0118 cm²/day). Cement is cheaper and globally available. However, cement requires ~6 weeks curing before use, and corals initially grew slower on cement (overtaking ceramic only after ~90 days). For A. pulchra operations, locally-made cement substrates can reduce costs without sacrificing growth.

4. HIGH INDIVIDUAL VARIATION WITHIN GENETS: Order of magnitude variation in growth rates among microfragments (0.003-0.035 cm²/day). Parent colony (ramet) significantly influenced growth as random effect. Faster-growing genets also showed higher variance. This suggests within-genet variation from ramet condition or microenvironmental factors—important for propagation planning.

5. GROWTH GENERALLY LINEAR BUT VARIABLE: Most microfragments showed linear growth over 193 days, though some followed logistic, logarithmic, or exponential patterns. Linear growth assumption is reasonable for short-term nursery projections, but longer-term models may need flexibility for varying growth trajectories among individuals and genets.
