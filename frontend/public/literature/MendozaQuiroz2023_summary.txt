ABSTRACT:
Acropora palmata is a foundational yet endangered Caribbean reef-building coral species. The lack of recovery after a disease outbreak and low recruitment has led to widespread use of fragmentation to restore populations. Another option is the production of sexual recruits (settlers) via assisted reproduction to improve the genetic diversity of depleted populations; however, the viability of this approach has not been tested over the long term. In 2011 and 2012, A. palmata larvae were cultured, settled, and the sexual recruits raised in an ex-situ nursery. Survival and growth were monitored over time. In 2014, these two F1 cohorts were moved to an in-situ nursery and after one year, a subset (29 colonies) was outplanted onto Cuevones Reef in the Mexican Caribbean. Growth and survival of these colonies were monitored periodically and compared to colonies that remained in the in-situ nursery. In 2019, samples were collected and analyzed for fertility and fecundity. 53% of the colonies were gravid and fecundity was 5.61±1.91 oocytes and 3.04±0.26 spermaries per polyp. A further 14 colonies from these two cohorts were outplanted in 2020 onto Picudas Reef and monitored during the subsequent spawning seasons. Two years after outplanting onto Picudas Reef, all colonies were alive and spawning of three of these colonies was recorded in 2022 in synchrony with the wild population. Gametes were collected from two colonies and crossed, with 15% fertilization success. Spermatozoa from wild colonies were then added and fertilization success increased to 95%. The resultant larvae followed normal development and symbiont uptake was visible within two weeks. The F2 generation was settled, maintained in an ex-situ nursery, and monitored for survival and growth. Both F1 and F2 generations followed a Type III survival curve with high initial mortality while in the ex-situ nursery and low later-stage mortality. The growth rates of these colonies increased three-fold after outplanting when compared to their growth rates in the ex-situ and in-situ nurseries. All colonies survived while in the in-situ nursery and for an additional nine years after outplanting onto Cuevones Reef. Overall, our results show that colonies produced by assisted breeding, once outplanted, may contribute to the genetic diversity and establishment of self-sustaining sexually-reproducing populations, which is an overarching goal of coral restoration programs.

KEY FINDINGS FOR ACROPORA PULCHRA RESTORATION:

1. SEXUAL RECRUITS REACH REPRODUCTIVE MATURITY: Lab-reared A. palmata colonies spawned synchronously with wild populations at 7-8 years post-settlement. 53% of outplanted colonies were gravid with normal fecundity (5.61 oocytes/polyp). This demonstrates sexual propagation can produce breeding adults for A. pulchra restoration within a decade.

2. TYPE III SURVIVAL CURVE WITH HIGH EARLY MORTALITY: 95% survival in first 3 months ex-situ, dropping to 31% at 4 months and 0.3% at 18 months (2011 cohort). However, once through early bottleneck, survival stabilized—100% survival in in-situ nursery phase and 9+ years post-outplanting on reef.

3. GROWTH RATES TRIPLE AFTER OUTPLANTING: Ex-situ growth ~2.5 mm/month, in-situ nursery ~1.9 mm/month, but reef-outplanted colonies grew at 5.6 mm/month. For A. pulchra, this suggests minimizing nursery residence time and outplanting earlier may optimize growth.

4. F2 GENERATION SUCCESSFULLY PRODUCED: Gametes from lab-reared colonies crossed with wild sperm achieved 95% fertilization (vs. 15% between siblings). F2 settlers survived and developed normally, proving multi-generational viability of sexual restoration approach.

5. 100% LONG-TERM REEF SURVIVAL: All 29 colonies outplanted to Cuevones Reef survived 9+ years; all 16 at Picudas Reef survived 2.5+ years despite hurricanes. Once established on reef, sexually-produced colonies show excellent persistence for A. pulchra population enhancement strategies.
