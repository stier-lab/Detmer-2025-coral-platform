So what (one sentence)
Simple stabilization of Acropora palmata fragments substantially improves tissue retention and attachment, demonstrating that low-cost intervention can enhance asexual recruitment in degraded reefs.

Study context
Species: Acropora palmata
Region: Biscayne National Park, Florida
Restoration context: Salvage and reattachment of storm-generated fragments
Depth: ~3 m

Methods (inference-relevant only)
- Naturally occurring fragments (<40 cm) assigned to three treatments:
  cable tie stabilization, epoxy stabilization, tethered unstabilized control
- 18 replicated blocks; monitored for 44 weeks
- Performance ranked by tissue retention and substrate attachment

Key results (numbers first)
- Stabilized fragments ranked higher in performance than controls
- Both cable ties and epoxy were similarly effective
- Unstabilized fragments lost more tissue and were more likely to flip or abrade

Mechanisms / drivers
- Stabilization prevents fragment movement and burial
- Early attachment promotes tissue spread and growth
- Tissue readily overgrew epoxy with no adverse effects

Restoration-relevant takeaways
- Fragment stabilization is a cost-effective restoration tool
- Salvaging storm fragments can enhance local recovery
- Simple methods scale well for management use

Limitations / external validity
- Short-term (44 weeks)
- Single site and depth

Anchor numbers & quotable facts
- Stabilized fragments consistently outperformed controls
- No detectable negative tissue response to epoxy
