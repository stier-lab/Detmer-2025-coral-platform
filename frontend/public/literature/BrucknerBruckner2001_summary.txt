ABSTRACT
Acropora palmata fragments generated by the Fortuna Reefer ship grounding (1997, Mona Island, Puerto Rico) were secured to reef substrate and to dead, standing A. palmata skeletons using stainless-steel wire (n=1,857). The purpose of this study was to assess fragment survivorship and condition 2 years after the attachment of fragments. Surviving fragments (57%) were larger than dead fragments (26%) and 17% were missing, mostly from shallow water. Live fragments had tissue covering 52% of upper branch surfaces; 23% of the live fragments experienced little or no tissue loss; 27% exhibited proto-branches; 14% had fused to the substrate; and 16% had overgrown the wire. Mortality was greatest in deeper water, especially among fragments secured to A. palmata skeletons. Mortality was attributed to overgrowth by Cliona spp. and macroalgae, predation by Coralliophila abbreviata and Hermodice carunculata, disease, and Stegastes planifrons territories. Limitations associated with the restoration technique include a low ability of coral tissue to overgrow wire and wire corrosion and breakage. Low rates of natural fusion and continued wire failure may hinder long-term recovery as storms periodically detach and remove restored fragments.

KEY FINDINGS FOR ACROPORA PULCHRA RESTORATION CONTEXT

1. SIZE-DEPENDENT SURVIVAL: Larger fragments had significantly higher survival (>75% for fragments >50 cm vs. 46% for <50 cm). Mean surviving fragment size was 69.8 cm vs. 52.2 cm for dead fragments. This suggests restoration efforts should prioritize larger fragments when possible.

2. LOW FUSION RATES ARE A CRITICAL BOTTLENECK: Only 10% of fragments naturally fused to substrate after 2 years, and only 16% overgrew attachment wire. This highlights that mechanical stabilization alone is insufficient—fragments must eventually self-attach to persist through storm disturbance.

3. ATTACHMENT SUBSTRATE MATTERS: Fragments secured to reef substrate had higher survival than those attached to standing dead coral skeletons, largely due to Cliona sponge overgrowth on skeletons. For A. pulchra restoration, substrate choice and condition should be carefully considered.

4. CHRONIC STRESSORS COMPOUND RESTORATION CHALLENGES: Even with successful initial attachment, fragments experienced ~48% tissue loss over 2 years from predation (Coralliophila, Hermodice), disease, algal overgrowth, and damselfish territories. Post-transplant monitoring and management of these stressors may improve outcomes.

5. ATTACHMENT METHOD AFFECTS TISSUE HEALTH: Wire contact caused tissue mortality in 73% of surviving fragments. Plastic cable ties performed better (68% tissue overgrowth). For branching Acropora restoration, attachment materials that minimize tissue contact damage should be preferred (epoxy, cement, or coated materials).
